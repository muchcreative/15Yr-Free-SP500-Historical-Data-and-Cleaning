## Part 3 - Handling Missing YF Historicals

As per Part 2, in this section we will go over what to do with our missing tickers that were not avaliable off of Yahoo Finance. Additionally, we must inspect the data we did download and check that all the data is there for the time that the tickers exist within the SP500. Once inspected we will go over ways to handle missing data and if possible, find ways to procure the missing information.

This is the last part of the tutorial and after this you should have a good start to your SP500 data and ideas on the characteristics of your data.
